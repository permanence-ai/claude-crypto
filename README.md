# safe-crypto-lib

A modern C++26 cryptography library with four interchangeable backends: PSA/MbedTLS 4.1, ARM intrinsics (ARMv8.2-A+crypto+sha3), OpenSSL 3.x, and Intel x86-64 intrinsics (SHA-NI, AES-NI, PCLMULQDQ). All operations return `std::expected` — no exceptions, no output parameters. Secrets are held in `SecureBuffer` / `FixedSecureBuffer` types that scrub memory on destruction.

## Problem Statement

A long-standing problem in the applied cryptography arena is that most cryptographic libraries assume the developer using them has sufficient applied crypto knowledge to use the libraries correctly. This is an unreasonable assumption. Most developers do not have applied crypto expertise, nor should they be expected to. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the design goals of most cryptographic libraries are maximal functionality and flexibility — not ensuring best practices, NIST/FIPS compliance, or enterprise policy enforcement. This library is an attempt to provide a very thin API layer on top of existing crypto implementations (SW and HW) that is easy to use correctly, and difficult to use incorrectly.

## Built by AI Agents

Every line of code, test, and CI configuration in this repository was written by AI coding agents — primarily Claude (Anthropic) and Codex (OpenAI). No human has written any of the source code, test cases, CMake build system, or GitHub Actions workflows. Human involvement has been limited to directing the agents and reviewing their output. Most pull requests have been merged by the agents themselves.

This project serves as an ongoing experiment in AI-driven software development: exploring how far autonomous coding agents can carry a non-trivial systems project — applied cryptography in modern C++ — without human authorship of the implementation itself.

## Design

### Error handling — `std::expected<T, CryptoError>`

Every function that can fail returns `std::expected<T, CryptoError>` — no exceptions, no output parameters, no boolean return codes. The error type carries a typed `CryptoErrorCode` and a human-readable message string.

Callers use the monadic interface (`value_or`, `and_then`, `transform`, `or_else`) or simple `has_value()` / `.error()` checks. There is nothing to catch and no way to silently discard a failure: the `[[nodiscard]]` attribute is applied to every returning function, so ignoring a result is a compile-time warning.

The distinction between the two failure channels is deliberate:
- **`std::unexpected(CryptoError(...))`** — a recoverable runtime condition: a PSA operation failed, a signature didn't verify, wire data was malformed. The caller is expected to handle or propagate these.
- **`SAFE_CRYPTO_PRE(cond)` contract** — a programming error: passing zero as `output_length`, indexing past the end of a buffer, calling `get()` on a moved-from key handle. These are bugs in the caller, not conditions to recover from.

### Precondition contracts — `SAFE_CRYPTO_PRE`

`contracts.hpp` defines a `SAFE_CRYPTO_PRE(cond)` macro that expands to the C++26 `[[pre: cond]]` attribute on GCC 15+ (compiled with `-fcontracts`) and to a no-op on other compilers. The macro is placed between the cv/ref qualifiers and the trailing return type:

```cpp
auto operator[](std::size_t i) SAFE_CRYPTO_PRE(i < data_.size()) -> CryptoByte&;
auto get() const noexcept SAFE_CRYPTO_PRE(valid_) -> KeyId;
```

Contracts are used at all points where a violated precondition indicates a bug rather than a runtime condition:

| Location | Precondition |
|---|---|
| `SecureBuffer::operator[]` | `i < data_.size()` |
| `FixedSecureBuffer::operator[]` | `i < N` |
| `SecureBuffer::resize` | `new_size <= data_.size()` (shrink-only) |
| `PsaKeyHandle::get()` | handle is valid (not moved-from) |
| `sigma_i_serialize_bundle` | both length fields fit in `uint16_t` |
| `derive_key_impl`, `expand_key_impl` | `output_length > 0` |
| `random_bytes_impl` | `length > 0` |

The companion macro `SAFE_CRYPTO_CONTRACTS_ENFORCED` is defined when contracts produce runtime checks. Test death-assertions are gated on this macro so they only run on compilers that actually enforce contracts.

### Provider abstraction — `CryptoProvider` concept

All crypto operations are templated on a `CryptoProvider` concept defined in `crypto_provider.hpp`. The concept requires associated types (`Status`, `KeyId`, `Algorithm`, `KeyAttributes`, `KdfOperation`, `KdfStep`), status sentinels, object factories, algorithm constants, and all low-level crypto primitives.

The default provider (`RealPsaBackend`) forwards to PSA/MbedTLS. A second provider (`ArmAsmBackend`) implements all operations directly via ARM Crypto Extension intrinsics — see [ARM ASM provider](#arm-asm-provider) below. A third provider (`OpenSslBackend`) implements the full API using the OpenSSL 3.x EVP high-level API — see [OpenSSL provider](#openssl-provider) below. A fourth provider (`IaAsmBackend`) implements hash/HMAC/HKDF/AEAD via Intel SHA-NI/AES-NI/PCLMULQDQ intrinsics — see [IA ASM provider](#ia-asm-provider) below. Tests use `MockPsaBackend` (GMock) to exercise every error path without inducing real PSA failures.

### No PSA types in library headers

The `safe-crypto-lib` INTERFACE target has zero dependency on MbedTLS headers. PSA-specific code lives entirely in `providers/psa_mbedtls/`. Swapping or adding a provider requires no changes to the library headers or any `_impl` function body.

### Memory safety — `SecureBuffer` and `PsaKeyHandle`

`SecureBuffer` (heap) and `FixedSecureBuffer<N>` (stack) zeroize their contents on destruction using a volatile byte loop that the compiler cannot optimize away. All key material, derived secrets, and intermediate buffers flow through these types — there is no `std::vector<uint8_t>` holding sensitive data anywhere in the library.

`PsaKeyHandle<Provider>` is an RAII wrapper around a PSA key ID. It calls `destroy_key` in its destructor and on every move-assignment path, ensuring that imported and generated keys are destroyed even when an error is returned mid-function. `get()` carries a precondition that the handle is valid, making use-after-move a detectable bug rather than silent UB.

### ARM ASM provider

`providers/arm_asm/` targets ARMv8.2-A+crypto+sha3 (Apple Silicon M1 and later). Most operations are header-only intrinsics — no MbedTLS dependency. When the LIBOQS supplement is enabled, `dilithium_ntt_neon.cpp` is added as an OBJECT library that overrides liboqs's scalar Dilithium NTT via link-order interposition. Compiled with `-march=armv8.2-a+crypto+sha3`.

**SHA-512 compression loop detail.** The two-round step pattern cycles through four roles (ab/cd/ef/gh) every eight rounds. Each step requires cross-pair word interleaving that cannot be expressed as a simple state rotation:

```cpp
// Rounds 0,1 — targets gh, updates cd
initial_sum = vaddq_u64(s0, vld1q_u64(sha512_k));
sum         = vaddq_u64(vextq_u64(initial_sum, initial_sum, 1), gh);
intermed    = vsha512hq_u64(sum, vextq_u64(ef, gh, 1), vextq_u64(cd, ef, 1));
gh          = vsha512h2q_u64(intermed, cd, ab);
cd          = vaddq_u64(cd, intermed);
```

Rounds 16–79 interleave message schedule (`vsha512su0q_u64` / `vsha512su1q_u64`) with compression, processing eight word pairs per loop iteration.

## Build

```bash
# Configure (PSA/MbedTLS provider, Debug build — the default)
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-debug -S .

# Build
cmake --build cmake-build-debug

# Test
./cmake-build-debug/safe-crypto-lib-test/safe_crypto_lib_test
```

### Build types

All build types are defined in `cmake/PermBuildOptions.cmake`. `Debug` is the default when no `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is specified.

| Build type | Optimisation | Hardening | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Debug` | `-O0 -g` | — | Development |
| `Release` | `-O3 -mtune=native -flto=thin` | `-fstack-protector-strong` `-mbranch-protection=standard` `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` dead-strip | Production / benchmarking |
| `MinSizeRel` | `-Os -flto=thin` | Same as Release | Size-constrained deployments |
| `RelWithDebInfo` | `-O2 -g` | — | Profiling / coverage |
| `Sanitize` | `-O1 -g` | ASan + UBSan (`-fsanitize=address,undefined`) | Defect detection |

**Hardening notes:**
- `-fstack-protector-strong` — stack canaries on any function with a buffer, array, or address-taken local
- `-mbranch-protection=standard` — ARM PAC (pointer authentication for return addresses) + BTI (branch target identification); enforced in hardware on Apple Silicon (ARMv8.5-a)
- `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` — compile-time and runtime bounds checks on libc memory/string functions

```bash
# Speed-optimised release build
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-release -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build cmake-build-release

# Size-optimised build
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-minsizerel -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel
cmake --build cmake-build-minsizerel

# Sanitizer build (ASan + UBSan)
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-sanitize -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Sanitize
cmake --build cmake-build-sanitize
./cmake-build-sanitize/safe-crypto-lib-test/safe_crypto_lib_test
```

## Testing

The test suite (`safe-crypto-lib-test/`) uses GoogleTest + GMock and is organised into five distinct testing strategies plus PQC-specific tests.

### 1. Mock-backend error-path tests (`psa_error_tests.hpp` — 107 tests)

`MockPsaBackend` is a GMock implementation of the `CryptoProvider` concept that intercepts every PSA call. Tests configure expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` to return specific `psa_status_t` error codes, then call the high-level `_impl` functions and assert the correct `CryptoError` variant is returned.

This covers every error branch in the library without needing to induce real PSA failures: key import failure, hash failure, MAC failure, KDF step failures, AEAD tag-check failure, ECDH failure, RSA failure, and so on. Every `std::unexpected` path in the library has at least one test here.

### 2. Known-answer-vector tests (`digests_tests.hpp`, `mac_tests.hpp`, `aead_tests.hpp`, `chacha20_tests.hpp`, `kdf_tests.hpp`, `ecc_tests.hpp`, `ecdh_tests.hpp`, `asymmetric_tests.hpp`, `sigma_tests.hpp`, `sigma_i_tests.hpp`, `random_tests.hpp`)

These run against the active provider (default: `RealPsaBackend`) and verify correct output for the full public API:

- **Digests** — SHA-256/384/512, SHA3-256/384/512: output length checks and known round-trip sanity.
- **MAC** — HMAC with all SHA variants: NIST HMAC test vectors; verify/reject paths.
- **AEAD** — AES-256-GCM: NIST SP 800-38D test vectors (with and without AAD); tag-tamper rejection.
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** — RFC 8439 test vectors; tag-tamper rejection; cross-decrypt (encrypt with one provider, decrypt with the other).
- **KDF** — HKDF and HKDF-Expand (SHA-384): RFC 5869 test vectors; state-machine error paths.
- **ECC / ECDH** — P-256/384/521 key generation, ECDSA sign/verify, ECDH shared-secret agreement.
- **Asymmetric** — RSA-OAEP 3072/4096 encrypt/decrypt round-trips.
- **SIGMA / SIGMA-I** — Full two-party handshake; identity hiding; tamper detection on MAC, signature, ephemeral key, and encrypted bundle IV fields; session key encrypt/decrypt round-trip; replay attack rejection; fresh handshakes produce distinct session keys.
- **Random** — Output length, non-zero probability, successive calls differ.

### 3. ARM ASM known-answer-vector tests (`arm_asm_tests.hpp` — 138 tests)

Guarded by `SAFE_CRYPTO_PROVIDER_ARM_ASM`, these test the ARM intrinsic implementations directly against published test vectors and boundary conditions:

- **AES-256-GCM** — NIST CAVP vectors (no-AAD and with-AAD cases); empty-plaintext tag-only case; decrypt tag-tamper rejection.
- **SHA3-256/384/512** — NIST test vectors for all three output sizes.
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** — RFC 8439 test vectors; tag-tamper rejection.
- **Poly1305** — RFC 8439 MAC vectors.
- **HKDF-SHA-384** — RFC 5869 test vectors exercising the full Extract+Expand path and the Expand-only variant.
- **EC key store** — boundary and error-path tests for the 16-slot EC key store.
- **Symmetric key store** — boundary and error-path tests for the 16-slot symmetric key store.
- **RSA key store** — boundary and error-path tests for the 8-slot RSA key store.
- **Key management** — `generate_key`, `import_key`, `export_key`, `destroy_key` round-trips and error paths.
- **ARM ASM backend errors** — every `std::unexpected` path exercised via direct backend calls.
- **Point utilities** — P-256/384/521 scalar multiplication edge cases.
- **ECDH peer validation** — invalid-curve attack prevention: wrong prefix, identity point, coordinate ≥ p, off-curve y, P-521 non-canonical high bits.
- **ECDSA signature decode** — strict r/s validation: r=0, s=0, r=n, s=n, r=n+1, all-ones, P-521 high-bit-set encodings rejected across all three curves.

These verify the ARM ASM provider's correctness independently of the PSA layer.

### 4. Cross-provider parity tests (`cross_provider_tests.hpp` — 29 tests)

Both `ArmAsmBackend` and `RealPsaBackend` are instantiated in the same binary regardless of the active provider. For each operation, the same input is fed to both backends and the outputs are compared byte-for-byte.

Operations covered: SHA-256/384/512, SHA3-256/384/512, HMAC-SHA-256/384/512, HMAC-SHA3-256/384/512, AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt/cross-decrypt (both directions), ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypt/decrypt/cross-decrypt (both directions), HKDF-SHA-384 extract+expand and HKDF-Expand-only parity, ECDH shared-secret parity (P-256/384/521), ECDSA cross-verify (P-384), RSA-OAEP cross-decrypt (3072/4096-bit), and RSA-PSS cross-verify (3072/4096-bit).

The cross-decrypt and cross-verify tests are particularly valuable: they encrypt or sign with one backend and decrypt or verify with the other, confirming wire-format compatibility rather than just output equality.

This strategy catches implementation drift that KAT tests cannot find — a wrong implementation can still pass a KAT if the reference vector was derived from the same wrong code.

### 5. Memory-safety tests (`secure_buffer_tests.hpp` — 8 tests)

Verify `SecureBuffer` and `FixedSecureBuffer<N>` behaviour: index operator reads and writes (mutable and const), iterator traversal (all four `begin()`/`end()` overloads), move semantics, `resize` (shrink-only), and — where C++26 contracts are enforced — death assertions for out-of-bounds access and resize-beyond-current-size.

## Coverage

LLVM source-based coverage measured against the `safe-crypto-lib/` headers for each provider build (Debug + `-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping`, run against the full test suite). Branch coverage is per-file; the TOTAL row includes all instrumented code in the binary (provider implementation headers, test utilities, etc.) which lowers the overall branch %.

### Coverage analysis

**What the uncovered lines are, across all providers:**

Every file with less than 100% line coverage has the same category of gap: **error-path `std::unexpected` returns**. No happy-path code is uncovered. Specifically:

- `aead.hpp`, `asymmetric.hpp`, `random.hpp` — `crypto_init()` failure return, key-import failure return, encrypt/decrypt failure return. These branches require inducing low-level PSA/OpenSSL failures; they are covered in the `PsaErrorTests` mock suite but that suite runs against `MockPsaBackend`, not the real backends, so real-provider builds don't count them.
- `kdf.hpp` — HKDF-info input failure (one specific KDF step error path) and a few `expand_key_impl` error returns not covered by `PsaErrorTests`.
- `sigma.hpp` / `sigma_i.hpp` — KDF setup/input failure returns inside `derive_keys` and `respond` paths. The happy-path handshake is fully covered; the three `sigma_i_deserialize_bundle` parse-error paths are directly tested; only injected-KDF/AES-failure branches remain uncovered in real-provider builds.
- `pqc_dsa.hpp` (OpenSSL — **62.6% lines**) / `pqc_kem.hpp` (OpenSSL — **63.3% lines**) — Same pattern: all error-path returns for keygen failure, key-export failure, sign failure, encap/decap failure. The PQC tests cover the happy path and tamper-detection path but do not inject low-level OpenSSL failures into `OQS_SIG_keypair` / `OQS_KEM_encaps` etc.

**Files at or above 80% in all providers:** `aead.hpp`, `asymmetric.hpp`, `crypto_error.hpp`, `crypto_provider.hpp`, `digests.hpp`, `ecc.hpp`, `ecdh.hpp`, `kdf.hpp`, `mac.hpp`, `random.hpp`, `secure_buffer.hpp`, `sigma.hpp`.

**Files below 80% in at least one provider:**
- `sigma_i.hpp` — 81.7% line / 69.1% branch (all providers). Remaining gap: injected-failure branches in `derive_keys_impl` and `sigma_i_aes_gcm_{encrypt,decrypt}_impl` — require fault injection into PSA/AES primitives.
- `pqc_dsa.hpp` — 62.6% lines (OpenSSL only). Missing: error-path returns for keygen/export/sign/verify failures — no mock infrastructure for `OQS_SIG_*` failures exists.
- `pqc_kem.hpp` — 63.3% lines (OpenSSL only). Same: error-path returns for keygen/export/encap/decap failures.

## Benchmarks

`safe-crypto-lib-bench` uses Google Benchmark (via FetchContent) to measure throughput across all operations. `RealPsaBackend`, `ArmAsmBackend`, and `OpenSslBackend` are all instantiated in the same binary so results are directly comparable. Symmetric payloads are swept across 64 B / 1 KiB / 16 KiB / 256 KiB; throughput is reported in GB/s or MB/s via `SetBytesProcessed`. EC, RSA, and PQC operations report ops/s. PQC benchmarks (ML-DSA, ML-KEM) across all three providers require `-DSAFE_CRYPTO_PQC=LIBOQS` at configure time.

```bash
# Build and run (Release mandatory for meaningful numbers)

ML-KEM is unaffected because the ARM backend uses mlkem-native's hand-written AArch64 assembly for its NTT — already optimal. ML-DSA uses the NEON NTT implemented in `providers/arm_asm/dilithium_ntt_neon.cpp`; it overrides the liboqs scalar C reference via link-order interposition (object files are resolved before archive members).

Notable findings:
- **SHA-256** sees the largest gain — `vsha256h`/`vsha256h2` intrinsics compress two rounds per cycle vs MbedTLS's scalar loop.
- **AES-256-GCM** is near-parity because MbedTLS already uses `vaeseq_u8`/`vmull_p64` hardware acceleration on this platform.
- **SHA3 / HMAC-SHA3** beats PSA at 2.1× after two optimization passes. (1) The first pass fully unrolled the ρ+π step, naming each of the 25 intermediate values explicitly so every rotation became a single `ROR Xd, Xn, #N`. (2) The second pass replaced the NEON `uint64x2_t`-pair implementation with a pure scalar one: all 25 Keccak state lanes remain in named `uint64_t` local variables throughout the round, eliminating the 50 `vgetq_lane_u64` vector-to-scalar lane extractions that dominated the NEON implementation's latency (each extraction costs ~3 cycles at 50×24 rounds = 3,600 scalar-pipeline stalls per permutation call).
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** leads MbedTLS at 1.33–1.37× after adding a 4-block NEON parallel ChaCha20 path. The keystream generator uses a word-major state layout where each of the 16 `uint32x4_t` registers holds one ChaCha20 state word across all four blocks. Both column and diagonal quarter-rounds are plain `chacha20_qr` calls (no `vextq` needed), and all four QRs within each round type operate on disjoint registers so the out-of-order pipeline issues them simultaneously. After 10 double-rounds the state is transposed back to block-major order with `vzipq_u32`/`vzip1q_u64`/`vzip2q_u64` and XOR'd directly with the input. Poly1305 already used 4-block parallelism and 3-limb 44-bit integer arithmetic (9 MUL+UMULH pairs per block) from the prior optimization pass.
- **ECDSA / ECDH** beats PSA across all three curves for verify and key agreement, and for sign on P-256. Four optimization passes compound here. First, a 4-bit fixed-base window over a precomputed [1..15]·G affine table replaces the variable-base double-and-add for k·G (signing) and u1·G (verification). Each nibble costs 4 doublings + 1 mixed Jacobian–affine add (Z₂=1, saving ~4 field multiplications per step), reducing the per-sign iteration count from 256→64 (P-256), 384→96 (P-384), 521→131 (P-521). Second, P-384 `fe384_mul` was rewritten as a 6×6 u64 schoolbook multiply (36 MUL-ACC) before Solinas reduction, replacing the old 12×12 u32 schoolbook (144 MUL-ACC). Third, P-384 field inversion and scalar inversion were replaced with addition chains: `fe384_invert` (used in affine conversion after every scalar multiplication) drops from ~702 field ops to ~490; `p384_scalar_invert` now stays in Montgomery domain throughout its addition chain, reducing cost from ~1344 to ~490 Montgomery multiplications. Fourth, a dormant bug in the point-doubling formula (present across all three curves) was fixed — the `8γ²` term was squaring γ twice rather than once. P-384 sign still trails PSA (0.92×) and P-521 sign at 0.67×; both have no hardware modular reduction and the variable-base `p*_scalar_mul(Q, ...)` for ECDH and u2·Q in verification does not yet use a precomputed window.
- **RSA** (3072 and 4096-bit) is implemented entirely in pure C++ without any PSA/MbedTLS dependency. Key generation uses Miller-Rabin primality testing (40 rounds) followed by CRT parameter computation. Public and private operations use CIOS Montgomery multiplication with a constant-time final reduction. OAEP and PSS padding use SHA-384 MGF1. ARM and PSA show near-parity because both use the same pure C++ implementation (PSA delegates to the same code path rather than MbedTLS's hardware-accelerated RSA).

## Provider selection

The active backend is controlled by the `SAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER` CMake cache variable. Pass it at configure time — CMake propagates the correct provider library and compile definitions to every target that links `safe_crypto_lib`, so no manual link step or compile flag is needed.

| Value | Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `PSA_MBEDTLS` *(default)* | MbedTLS 4.1 PSA Crypto API | Production |
| `ARM_ASM` | ARMv8.2-A+crypto intrinsics (Apple Silicon) | Full — hashing, HMAC, AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, HKDF, ECDSA/ECDH P-256/384/521, RSA-OAEP/PSS 3072/4096 (pure C++, no MbedTLS), key management |
| `OPENSSL` | OpenSSL 3.x EVP API | Full + SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, all 6 SHA2 variants) + ML-DSA (FIPS 204, parameter sets 44/65/87) + ML-KEM (FIPS 203, parameter sets 512/768/1024) — 249 tests; requires OpenSSL 3.0+ (`find_package(OpenSSL 3.0 REQUIRED)`) |
| `IA_ASM` | x86-64 SHA-NI + AES-NI + PCLMULQDQ + SSE2/SSSE3 | Full — hash/HMAC/HKDF/AEAD via x86 intrinsics; EC/RSA/PQC/random reuse arm_asm pure-C++ bignum (x86-portable); cross-compiled on Apple Silicon via `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64`, runs under Rosetta 2 (SHA-NI not emulated) |

A second CMake variable, `SAFE_CRYPTO_PQC`, controls an optional PQC supplement fetched via FetchContent:

| `SAFE_CRYPTO_PQC` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `NONE` *(default)* | No PQC supplement; `ARM_ASM` and `PSA_MBEDTLS` providers return `err_invalid_arg` for ML-DSA and ML-KEM |
| `LIBOQS` | Fetches [liboqs 0.13.0](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and wires ML-DSA 44/65/87 and ML-KEM 512/768/1024 into the `ARM_ASM` and `PSA_MBEDTLS` backends via `providers/liboqs/liboqs_pqc.hpp`; defines `SAFE_CRYPTO_PQC_LIBOQS`; adds 13 PQC tests (447 total for `ARM_ASM+LIBOQS`; 239 total for `PSA_MBEDTLS+LIBOQS`); when combined with `OPENSSL`, also activates 6 cross-provider parity tests (255 total for `OPENSSL+LIBOQS`); `OQS_KEM` and `OQS_SIG` descriptors are allocated once per variant (C++11 thread-safe local statics) and reused across all operations — `OQS_KEM_new()`/`OQS_SIG_new()` are no longer called per-operation |

SLH-DSA is not yet available via liboqs (liboqs 0.13.0 uses `SPHINCS+` naming internally and has no `slh_dsa` aliases). It remains OpenSSL-only.

```bash
# Use the ARM ASM provider
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-arm-asm -S . -DSAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER=ARM_ASM

# Use the IA ASM provider (cross-compile for x86_64 on Apple Silicon)
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-ia-asm -S . \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER=IA_ASM

# Use the ARM ASM provider with liboqs PQC supplement
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-arm-asm-pqc -S . \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER=ARM_ASM \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_PQC=LIBOQS

# Use the OpenSSL provider (macOS with Homebrew)
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-openssl -S . \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER=OPENSSL \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3

# Use the OpenSSL provider with liboqs PQC supplement (enables cross-provider parity tests)
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-openssl-pqc -S . \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER=OPENSSL \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_PQC=LIBOQS \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3

# Use the PSA/MbedTLS provider with liboqs PQC supplement
cmake -G Ninja -B cmake-build-psa-pqc -S . \
  -DSAFE_CRYPTO_PQC=LIBOQS
```

Specifying an unrecognised value is a configure-time fatal error that lists the valid choices. Adding a new provider means creating a `providers/<name>/` subdirectory with a backend struct and CMakeLists, then registering it in the top-level `SAFE_CRYPTO_ACTIVE_PROVIDER` string list.

### IA ASM provider

`providers/ia_asm/` targets x86-64 with SHA-NI, AES-NI, PCLMULQDQ, and SSE2/SSSE3. Hash/HMAC/HKDF/AEAD operations use x86 intrinsics; EC scalar math, RSA bignum, and PQC operations reuse the `arm_asm::detail` pure-C++ implementation (which has no NEON dependency). Compiled with `-march=x86-64-v2 -maes -msha -mpclmul -mssse3`.

On macOS with Apple Silicon, cross-compile with `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64`. The resulting binary runs under Rosetta 2, which emulates AES-NI and most SSE extensions but **does not emulate SHA-NI** (`sha256rnds2`, `sha256msg1`, `sha256msg2`). Tests that require SHA-NI (all digest and HMAC tests) will SIGILL under Rosetta; RSA, AEAD (ChaCha20-Poly1305), and most buffer/error-path tests pass.

**Implemented operations:**

| Operation | Notes |
|---|---|
| SHA-256 | `_mm_sha256rnds2_epu32` SHA-NI rounds; full padding; requires native x86 |
| SHA-384 / SHA-512 | SSE2 scalar compression; no special extensions needed |
| SHA3-256/384/512 | Same scalar Keccak as ARM ASM, x86-portable |
| HMAC-SHA-256/384/512 | SHA-NI / SSE2 |
| HMAC-SHA3-256/384/512 | Scalar Keccak |
| AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt | AES-NI key expansion + CTR; PCLMULQDQ GHASH |
| ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypt/decrypt | SSE2 quarter-round; Poly1305 with SIMD |
| HKDF / HKDF-Expand (SHA-384) | RFC 5869 state machine |
| ECDSA P-256/384/521 sign/verify | RFC 6979 deterministic k via ia_asm HMAC; EC math reuses `arm_asm::detail` |
| ECDH P-256/384/521 | Pure C++ scalar multiplication |
| RSA-OAEP-3072/4096 encrypt/decrypt | SHA-384 MGF1 using ia_asm SHA-384; same pure C++ bignum |
| RSA-PSS-3072/4096 sign/verify | SHA-384 MGF1 using ia_asm SHA-384 |
| RSA key generation | Same Miller-Rabin + CRT as ARM ASM |
| EC/RSA key store | Shared `arm_asm::detail` key stores (same 16-slot EC, 8-slot RSA) |
| Random bytes | `arc4random_buf` |
| ML-DSA / ML-KEM | Via liboqs supplement (`SAFE_CRYPTO_PQC=LIBOQS`) |

### OpenSSL provider

`providers/openssl/` implements the full `CryptoProvider` API via the OpenSSL 3.x EVP high-level interface. It uses `find_package(OpenSSL 3.0 REQUIRED)` — no FetchContent. On macOS with Homebrew, pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3` at configure time.

**Key design choices:**

- EC private keys are stored and exported as native-endian BIGNUM scalars (via `BN_bn2nativepad`) so they round-trip through `OSSL_PARAM_construct_BN` / `EVP_PKEY_fromdata` correctly on both ARM (little-endian) and x86 (big-endian).
- EC key pairs are imported using `EVP_PKEY_fromdata` with only the private scalar — OpenSSL computes the public key automatically. The resulting key pair passes sign/verify and ECDH agreement.
- EC public keys are imported via `EVP_PKEY_fromdata` with the uncompressed point (04‖x‖y); exported via `OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_PUB_KEY`.
- RSA private keys are PKCS#1 DER (`i2d_PrivateKey` / `d2i_PrivateKey`). RSA public keys are SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER (`i2d_PublicKey` / `d2i_PublicKey`). This matches what PSA exports and enables cross-provider key compatibility.
- RSA-OAEP uses SHA-384 for both the hash and MGF1 parameters. The optional label is heap-allocated via `OPENSSL_malloc` and ownership is transferred to OpenSSL via `EVP_PKEY_CTX_set0_rsa_oaep_label`.
- RSA-PSS uses `RSA_PSS_SALTLEN_DIGEST` (salt length = hash length = 48 bytes for SHA-384).
- Asymmetric keys are stored in a 64-slot `EVP_PKEY*` store (IDs 1–64); symmetric and derive keys are stored as raw bytes in a 64-slot `FixedSecureBuffer<256>` store (IDs 65–128).

## Command-line interface (`scli`)

`safe-crypto-cli/scli` is a command-line tool that exposes the library's cryptographic operations directly from the shell. It is built alongside the library and tests; no separate install step is needed.

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build -S .
cmake --build build --target scli
./build/safe-crypto-cli/scli --help
```

### Input/output conventions

All subcommands share the same input/output model:

| Spec | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `base64:<data>` | Literal base64-encoded bytes on the command line |
| `-` | Read from stdin (input) / write raw binary to stdout (output) |
| `<path>` | Read from / write to a file (raw binary) |
| *(omit `--output`)* | Base64-encode and print to stdout |

### Subcommands

#### `digest` — Compute a cryptographic hash

```
scli digest --algo <alg> --input <spec> [--output <spec>]
```

`--algo`: `sha256` `sha384` `sha512` `sha3-256` `sha3-384` `sha3-512`

```bash
# SHA-256 of "hello world" from stdin
echo -n "hello world" | scli digest --algo sha256 --input -

# SHA-384 of a file, save raw binary to another file
scli digest --algo sha384 --input message.bin --output hash.bin

# Inline base64 input
scli digest --algo sha3-256 --input base64:aGVsbG8=
```

#### `mac` — Generate or verify an HMAC

```
scli mac --algo <alg> --key <spec> --input <spec> [--output <spec>] [--verify <spec>]
```

`--algo`: `sha256` `sha384` `sha512`

Without `--verify`, generates and outputs the MAC. With `--verify`, compares the computed MAC to the one supplied — exits 0 on match, 1 on mismatch (no output either way).

```bash
# Generate HMAC-SHA-256
scli mac --algo sha256 --key base64:<key-b64> --input message.bin

# Verify (exits 0 if correct, 1 if not)

```

#### `aead` — Authenticated encryption / decryption

```
scli aead --algo <alg> --op encrypt|decrypt --key <spec> --input <spec>
          [--output <spec>] [--aad <spec>]
```

`--algo`: `aes256-gcm` `chacha20-poly1305`  
Key must be exactly 32 bytes. Wire format for both algorithms: `IV (12 bytes) ‖ ciphertext+tag`.

```bash
# Encrypt
scli aead --algo aes256-gcm --op encrypt \
  --key base64:<32-byte-key-b64> \
  --input plaintext.bin --output ciphertext.bin

# Decrypt
scli aead --algo aes256-gcm --op decrypt \
  --key base64:<32-byte-key-b64> \
  --input ciphertext.bin --output plaintext.bin

# With additional authenticated data
scli aead --algo chacha20-poly1305 --op encrypt \
  --key base64:<key-b64> --input message.bin --aad base64:<aad-b64>
```

#### `ecdsa` — ECDSA key generation, signing, and verification

```
scli ecdsa keygen --curve p256|p384|p521
                  [--out-private <spec>]  # default: base64 to stdout
                  [--out-public  <spec>]  # default: base64 to stdout

scli ecdsa sign   --curve p256|p384|p521
                  --key    <spec>         # private key (raw DER bytes)
                  --input  <spec>         # message to sign
                  [--output <spec>]       # signature (default: base64 to stdout)

scli ecdsa verify --curve p256|p384|p521
                  --key       <spec>      # public key (raw DER bytes)
                  --input     <spec>      # message
                  --signature <spec>      # signature
                  # exits 0 = valid, 1 = invalid
```

Keys are raw DER-encoded bytes (private key: raw scalar; public key: uncompressed point).

```bash
# Generate a P-256 key pair
scli ecdsa keygen --curve p256 \
  --out-private priv.der --out-public pub.der

# Sign a message
scli ecdsa sign --curve p256 \
  --key priv.der --input base64:aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=

# Verify a signature (exits 0 = valid)
scli ecdsa verify --curve p256 \
  --key pub.der --input base64:aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ= \
  --signature base64:<sig-b64>
```

#### `ecdh` — ECDH key agreement

```
scli ecdh keygen  --curve p256|p384|p521
                  [--out-private <spec>]    # default: base64 to stdout
                  [--out-public  <spec>]    # default: base64 to stdout

scli ecdh compute --curve p256|p384|p521
                  --key         <spec>      # our private key (raw DER bytes)
                  --peer-public <spec>      # peer's public key (raw DER bytes)
                  [--output     <spec>]     # shared secret (default: base64 to stdout)
```

Typical use: both parties run `keygen`, exchange public keys out-of-band, then each runs `compute` with their own private key and the peer's public key — both sides obtain the same shared secret. Output sizes: P-256 → 32 bytes, P-384 → 48 bytes, P-521 → 66 bytes.

```bash
# Party A generates a key pair
scli ecdh keygen --curve p256 \
  --out-private a_priv.der --out-public a_pub.der

# Party B generates a key pair
scli ecdh keygen --curve p256 \
  --out-private b_priv.der --out-public b_pub.der

# A computes shared secret using B's public key
scli ecdh compute --curve p256 \
  --key a_priv.der --peer-public b_pub.der

# B computes shared secret using A's public key (same result)
scli ecdh compute --curve p256 \
  --key b_priv.der --peer-public a_pub.der
```

scli rsa oaep-encrypt --bits 3072|4096
                      --key    <spec>          # public key DER
                      --input  <spec>          # plaintext
                      [--output <spec>]        # ciphertext (default: base64 to stdout)
                      [--label  <spec>]        # optional OAEP label

scli rsa oaep-decrypt --bits 3072|4096
                      --key    <spec>          # private key DER

                      [--label  <spec>]

scli rsa pss-sign     --bits 3072|4096
                      --key    <spec>          # private key DER
                      --input  <spec>          # message
                      [--output <spec>]        # signature (default: base64 to stdout)

scli rsa pss-verify   --bits 3072|4096
                      --key       <spec>       # public key DER
                      --input     <spec>       # message
                      --signature <spec>
                      # exits 0 = valid, 1 = invalid
```

```bash
# Generate a 3072-bit key pair
scli rsa keygen --bits 3072 \
  --out-private priv.der --out-public pub.der

# Encrypt / decrypt
scli rsa oaep-encrypt --bits 3072 --key pub.der \

scli rsa pss-verify --bits 3072 --key pub.der  --input message.bin \
  --signature base64:<sig-b64>
```

#### `kdf` — HKDF key derivation (SHA-384)

```
scli kdf derive --length <N> [--ikm <spec>] [--salt <spec>] [--info <spec>]
                [--output <spec>] [--out-ikm <file>]

scli kdf expand --length <N> --prk <spec> [--info <spec>] [--output <spec>]
```

- `derive` runs HKDF Extract+Expand. `--ikm` must be at least `2 * length` bytes. If omitted, random IKM is generated and written to `--out-ikm` for reproducibility.
- `expand` runs HKDF-Expand only; `--prk` is the SHA-384-length pseudorandom key (48 bytes).

```bash
# Derive a 32-byte key from random IKM, saving the IKM for later reproduction
scli kdf derive --length 32 --out-ikm ikm.bin

# Reproduce the same key from the saved IKM
scli kdf derive --length 32 --ikm ikm.bin

# Derive with salt and context info
scli kdf derive --length 32 --ikm base64:<ikm-b64> \
  --salt base64:<salt-b64> --info base64:<info-b64>

# Expand from a PRK, output raw binary
scli kdf expand --length 32 --prk prk.bin --output derived.bin
```

### CLI tests

A separate test suite (`safe-crypto-cli-test/`) drives `scli` as a subprocess and validates stdout and exit codes using GoogleTest. 140 tests on the default build, plus 17 ML-KEM/ML-DSA tests (LIBOQS build) and 8 SLH-DSA tests (OpenSSL build):

```bash
cmake --build build --target safe_crypto_cli_test
cd build && ctest -R "AeadTests|DigestTests|EcdhTests|EcdsaTests|IoTests|KdfTests|MacTests|MlDsaTests|MlKemTests|RandomTests|RsaTests|SlhDsaTests"
```

> **Note:** RSA tests are slow in debug builds (~4 min) due to Miller-Rabin primality testing. Use a release build for speed: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
